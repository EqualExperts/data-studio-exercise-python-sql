Write a README for the reviewer



## Exercise Instructions

This is a bootstrap project to load interesting data from a Stack Exchange dataset into a data warehouse.
You are free to change anything about this bootstrap solution as you see fit, so long as it can still be executed by a reviewer.

- The project is set up to use Pipenv & Python 3.8
- SQLite3 provides an infrastructure-free simple data warehouse stand-in
- Facilites for linting etc. are provided as scripts and integrated with Pipenv
- A script to fetch the dataset is provided and integrated with Pipenv

Your task is to make it convenient for data scientists to execute analytics-style queries reliably over the Posts and Tags tables.
You will be asked to demonstrate the solution, including:
- how you met the data scientist needs
- how you did (or would) ensure data quality
- what would to be done for the solution scale to work with a 10TB dataset with new data arriving each day
